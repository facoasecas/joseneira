                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>Flat kaleidoscope is comprised of four pieces made of chestnut wood, plexiglass and transparent film. The first piece contains four letters ‘a’ (its counterforms) that are placed on three separate layers of film. Just like with a typical cylindric kaleidoscope you only have so much control of the movement of parts inside of it and since there are four letters, the transformation of one letter affects the others. The fourth piece contains moiré patterns from screens and textures made of the repetition of tiny ‘aes’, a ‘soup’ of letters, and only vestiges of the initial four letters. So you see the letterforms, grids and textures overlaping in motion; is very much like creating your own motion graphics with no screen, no digital anything.</p>
                        <p>Playing with letters and sreens on transparent film was the starting point of what became my senior project. The encouragement of professor Carol Bankerd was as important as the help from my friend and fellow student Peter Kaufmann—furniture designer who studied under Ken Strickland—who kindly helped me with the woodwork in the extraordinary woodshop housed in the Visual Arts building.</p>
                        <p>My undergraduate years at Purchase College, NY are the happiest and most fascinating in my life. The ‘soaring’ 80’s and its rich ambience, teachers and campus life that I would relive tomorrow, if I could.</p>
                        <p>My design teachers, Carol Bankerd, Larry Bach, (Warren Lehrer, whom I only got to know in my senior year) and many others; Judith Bernstein, painting; Scott Richter, drawing; Murray Zimiles, drawing and printmaking; Antonio Frasconi, printmaking; Jed Devine, photography, are some of the names I cherish. And Patty Smith, who helped me print a wonderfull poster to promote a new MFA program for 1984 (three colors, off-set lithography). Every one of these professors left in me a big joy in making, thinking and looking. Visiting art galleries in New York with art history professor Irving Sandler was marvelous. As with Carol Bankerd, just their sheer passion for art and design was a profound learning experience for me.</p>
