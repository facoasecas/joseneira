                            The term <em>design</em> conjures up the idea of <em>utility</em>. However, the sentence <em>visual design</em> opens up a space where the <em>utility</em> of what we see is not readily identifiable. One could
                            say that this enigma is what <em>beauty</em> is, a dimension, perhaps, easier to understand in music, for example. Music is much more than mere utility and we do not know how to fully explain why. This matter has
                            occupied me since my youth. It is a problem that comes into play in every visual design project that we embark on.

                        <h4>To observe</h4>
                        <p>
                            We look carefully at the context and environments that are relevant to the organization. We learn about their needs and areas of difficulty, ask questions and come to conclusions. With this perspective, we plan a
                            project, whether for a small or a large organisation.
                        </p>

                        <h4>To plan</h4>

                        <p>
                            Whether a visual identity, an advertising, editorial, or packaging project, the conclusions reached in the previous stage are translated into concepts, discourses and strategies, and finally into visual design,
                            the most challenging and intense part of the process. This method invariably takes place in co-creation, in close collaboration with the customer.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Visual identity and brand architecture</h4>

                        <p>
                            The visual identity of an organization or person is a language that defines their spirit and character—graciously. It is exhibited in all the necessary environments, giving unity and strength to the brand, both
                            in-house and externally. It is not only about the visual, it is also about verbal expressions as well. Brand architecture, on the other hand, focuses on giving visual coherence to the brand and its formal
                            variants, an array of applications, spaces and media where the brand comes to life.
